# DarkModeMod
This mod aims to allow for dynamic switching between light and dark mode, and will eventually have support for reflecting multiple operating system's current dark mode selection, or a custom schedule which can be set in the config.

The dark mode interface will include dark versions of in-game GUIs like the inventory (which I hope to eventually extend to other mods too) as well as the main menu buttons.
